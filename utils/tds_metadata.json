They\u2019re perfect for small web tools that don\u2019t need to run all the time. Here are some common real-life uses:\nA contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\nA tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\nA chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\nA newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\nA webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they\u2019re done, these copies disappear.",

    "text": "Vector Databases\nVector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently.\nUse vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON\u2019T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.)\nVector databases are an evolving space.\nThe first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:\nchroma 19,637 \u2b50 May 2025\nqdrant 23,341 \u2b50 May 2025\nlancedb 6,327 \u2b50 May 2025\nfaiss 34,684 \u2b50 May 2025\nmilvus 34,476 \u2b50 May 2025\nweaviate 13,222 \u2b50 May 2025\nIn addition, most relational databases now support vector search.",

Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025.\nFor questions, use this Discourse thread.\nBackground\nYou have joined the operations team at DataWorks Solutions, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.\nDue to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.\nYour assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain\u2011English tasks, carries out the required (multi\u2011step) process leveraging an LLM where required.",

Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using python -m venv <env_name>. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., .\\env\\Scripts\\activate). Install Flask using pip install flask. Create a .gitignore file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a vercel.json file with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub.",

    "text": "Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub. This is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).\nQ6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?\nA6: When deploying to Vercel, the port number you use locally doesn\u2019t matter because Vercel will assign your application its own domain. You should remove debug=True from your Flask application before deploying to production.\nQ7: Why do I need administrator permissions to use ngrok?\nA7: ngrok is a command-line tool that forwards requests to your local host. It doesn\u2019t need to be installed in your virtual environment. However, you might need administrator privileges to forward requests through a port.",

    "text": "If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as administrator.\nQ8: What is ngrok and how does it work?\nA8: ngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it\u2019s running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.\nQ9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?\nA9: A virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project. This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool.",

I\u2019ll look at the forum later.\nQ3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?\nA3: Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools.\nQ4: What is the concept behind Project One?\nA4: Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline.

Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM.\nQ5: What kind of tasks can I expect?\nA5: There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system\u2019s ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: \u201crun\u201d and \u201cread\u201d.

It\u2019s deployed on Hugging Face.\nQ32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?\nA32: I think it\u2019s been removed. It would be too heavy for TDS.\nQ33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?\nA33: Not exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words.

The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application.\nQ8: Is the order function dependent on the above-written cell?\nA8: Yes, the order function uses variables defined in previous cells.\nQ9: How is the JSON response handled?\nA9: The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process.

This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin.\nQ6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?\nA6: No, there\u2019s no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it.

This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients.\nQ11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?\nA11: The GA3 project will involve using the concepts covered today, but on a larger scale.

The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL.\nQ27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?\nA27: The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM.\nQ28: For task 3, what is the expected output?\nA28: The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task.",

I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?\nA30: You can compare the decoded image from both methods visually. The size and resolution should be the same. If the encoding is correct, the decoded image will match the original. You can also encode the image using an encoder to verify.\nQ31: In previous assignments, some answers disappeared after logging out.

This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones.\nQ2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?\nA2: This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The IMPORTHTML function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel.\nQ3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?\nA3: I\u2019ll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube.\nQ4: What do the parameters in the IMPORTHTML function mean?\nA4: The four parameters are: URL, query (either \u201clist\u201d or \u201ctable\u201d), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python).\nQ5: How does the IMPORTHTML function automatically find the table?\nA5: It finds the table based on the index you provide.",

This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The $$ operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The . prefix selects elements by class, and # selects by ID.\nMethod 3: Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself.

I\u2019ve posted on Discourse multiple times, but it\u2019s still not working.

We can also schedule a separate meeting to discuss this further. The issue might be related to how your system interacts with the host (it might be localhost).\nQ9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?\nA9: The scope is indeed broad. The project\u2019s requirements are defined by Anand, who is also the CEO of a company.",

However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease.\nQ2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday\u2019s session?\nA2: It\u2019s already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video.\nQ3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?\nA3: First, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman.",

The instructor explains how to use the find_all function to locate specific tags (e.g., \u201citem\u201d) and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between find and findall functions. The instructor notes that if you encounter issues, you can use an XML viewer to examine the structure of the XML file. The instructor also explains that you should use an XML parser (lxml) instead of an HTML parser.\nQ8: How do I handle situations where the number of values in different lists doesn\u2019t match?\nA8: If the lengths of lists (e.g., product names, prices, links) don\u2019t match, it usually means there\u2019s an extra value.",

If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g., page=2 for the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages.\nQ11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?\nA11: Always check the website\u2019s terms and conditions before scraping.

No other image id will be evaluated.\n\n\nHow to fix bugs in our scripts\n\n\nCreate Pull requests to \nJivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1\n .\n\n\nDocker Image Architecture Issue Report\n\n\nIf your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:\n\n\nSubmit Report\n\n\nBug fixes\n\n\nIf you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTDS Team",

Project Updates\n\n\n\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16.

ROE Score Update\n\n\n\n\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns.

However, in GA6, we moved to \nSeek\n and in GA7, to \nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\n3. ROE Score Update\n\n\n\n\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\n\n\nKind regards",

    "text": "Thank you for your response \n@carlton\n and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\n\n\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\n\n\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\n\n\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nLakshay",

    "text": "@23f2003413\n\n\nWe will have it uploaded sometime this morning.\n\n\nIt has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\n\n\n\nThe chaos of ROE.\n\n\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\n\n\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\n\n\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\n\n\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\n\n\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction \u2192 Data Cleaning \u2192 Data Transformation \u2192 Data Analyisis \u2192 Information to answer questions\n\n\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\n\n\nHow limited the time is.\n\n\n\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\n\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\n\n\nToday\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\n\n\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\n\n\nKind regards",

The \nlive sessions and guidance\n have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\n\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\n\n\nKey Challenges Faced\n\n\n \nLack of Prerequisites\n\n\nThis course did not list any \nprerequisites\n, leading many students\u2014including those from \nnon-technical backgrounds\n\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the \ncourse content, assignments, and projects\n have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n\n \nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\n\n\nThe \ndifficulty of the projects\n has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to \nrely heavily on peer support\n just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n\n\n \nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\n\n\nMany students joined \nTDS\n based on past \nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for \nworking professionals\n and students without prior experience.\n\n\n \nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\n\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending \n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\n to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves \nstruggling to meet expectations\n for the \nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\n\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\n\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\n\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",

This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\n\n\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\n\n\n\n\nMany students pursuing this course are \ndual-degree students or working professionals\n, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\n\n\nThe \nlast-minute guidance\n for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\n\n\nThe \nstructuring and scheduling of sessions\n feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\n\n\n\n\nRequest for Improvement\n\n\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\n\n\n\n\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2\n, well in advance of the deadline.\n\n\nMore structured and accessible support\n, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\n\n\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels\n, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\n\n\n\n\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.

Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\n\n\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the \ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\n\n\n\n\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this \nDiscourse thread\n where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the \nfirst page of the TDS course\n GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\n\nHere\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:\n\n\n\n\nIt \nused\n to be an easy course until 2024. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nNow it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nLLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. \n#\n \n#\n\n\nThe ROE is hard. \n#\n\n\n\n\nTake Graded assignment 1\n to check if you\u2019re ready for this course.\n Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - \nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\n\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\n\nYou \nCAN\n copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n\nWhy should you copy?\n Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.\n\n\nTo learn well, understand\n what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.\n\n\nTo learn better, teach\n what you\u2019ve learnt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\n\nOnce again Anand has a \nnice blog\n where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\n\n\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n\n\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - \nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\n The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n\n\n@22f2001640\n Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I\u2019m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\n\n\nI understand that the grading can\u2019t be changed.

These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\n\n\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\n\n\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\n\n\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\n\n\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\n\n\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\n\n\nThanks for bearing with us.

ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question.

Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\n\n\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\n\n\nKind regards",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\n\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\n\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\n\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

Here are the highlights of the discussion:\n\n\n\n\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\n\n\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\n\n\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\n\n\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\n\n\n\n\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\n\n\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\n\n\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\n\n\nKind regards\n\nTDS Team",

We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.",

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Hi Vikram,\n\n\nThis is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\n\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\n\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\n\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\n\n\n\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n\n\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\n\n\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n\n\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\n\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\n\n\nRun evalute.py using uv.\n\n\n\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\n\n\nHope that gives clarity.\n\n\nKind regards",

    "text": "Hi Hari,\n\n\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\n\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\n\n\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\n\n\nKind regards",

    "text": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\n\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical?\n\n\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.",

    "text": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation\n \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility\n \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortability\n \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\n\n\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Best for \nreproducibility\n and \ncollaboration\n since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n\n\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.\n\n\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\n\n\u2022 If you \ndon\u2019t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\n\n\u2022 If you \ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n\n\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\n\n\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\n\n\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n\n\u2022 Using \ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n\n\u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\n\nBest Practices Summary\n\n\n\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n\n\nUse a \nrequirements.txt\n file for reproducibility.\n\n\nPin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n\n\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\n\n\n\nKind regards",

    "text": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\n\n\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\n\n\n\n\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing to your second question,\n\n\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\n\n\n\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\n\n\n\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, \npip3 freeze > requirements.txt \n. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you",

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\n\n\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don\u2019t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\n\n\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there\u2019s a better way to balance this.\n\n\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",
